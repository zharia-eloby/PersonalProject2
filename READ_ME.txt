IDEA FOR THE GAME:
(still working on this) 
- The player must maneuver through the environment in order to collect certain items that will help
them defeat the final boss.
- The player will start in an outdoor forest environment. Then, they'll find a cave somewhere and go into
the cave to enter an underground temple. Then, after going through the temple, they'll find themselves in
a dungeon like arena where the final boss awaits.
- There are 3 different weapons with different abilities. The sword is for close attacks and does 
a small amount of damage. The bow and arrow is for medium attack distance and does a medium amount of damage. The spear is for
far attacks and does the most damage out of the three. 

WHAT IS WORKING?
- enemies move through animations
- shooting the enemies with bow and arrows decreases the enemies health
- changing weapons
- picking up a quiver gives extra arrows
- text appears on screen when needed

WHAT I AM STILL WORKING ON?
- deciding on game concept
- audio
- game environment
- having the arrows stick onto the enemy instead of bouncing off
- implementing a flocking mentality with the zorlik enemies
- smooth sword movements
- start and end screens

CONTROLS:
- change weapon by pressing c
- zoom in to aim bow and arrow by pressing n
- shoot an arrow by pressing m
- pick up arrows by pressing k (when you can do this, you will see a message at the bottom of the screen)
- lunge sword by pressing b
- swing sword by pressing v
- raise shield by pressing x

NOTES:
- all of the models and animations are imported assets from the unity asset store
- the wall was used to test out physics interactions and collisions with the arrows
